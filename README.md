- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
